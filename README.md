HTML Structure
The HTML structure is built using semantic HTML5 elements for a clear and logical layout. It includes the following sections:

Header with navigation bar
Main content sections for Home, Services, About, and Contact
Footer with copyright information
CSS Styling and Animations
The CSS file (styles.css) provides consistent styling across the website, including:

Custom styling for the navigation bar, sections, buttons, and footer
Responsive design using media queries to adapt to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
CSS animations for button hover effects and transitioning background colors
Media Queries
Media queries are used to ensure the design is responsive and user-friendly across different devices. Key aspects addressed by media queries include:

Adjusting padding, margins, and font sizes for readability and usability on smaller screens
Changing the layout of the navigation bar and buttons for improved navigation on mobile devices
